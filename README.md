# **Python Automation and Network Protocols - Jupyter Notebook Examples**

This repository contains a comprehensive set of Python examples for various network protocol automations and process automations. All examples have been executed and tested in a Jupyter Notebook environment. However, some functionalities may only show output in a terminal and cannot be fully demonstrated within the notebook. 

To view the complete outputs and run the code, you can download the files and open them locally using Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda) or Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter Notebook extension.

## Topics Covered

1. **Network Protocol Automation**
   - **Telnet**: Automating Telnet connections and sending commands using `telnetlib`.
   - **FTP**: Uploading and downloading files using `ftplib`.
   - **SSH**: Connecting to remote servers via SSH and executing commands with `paramiko`.
   - **SCP**: Secure file transfer using SCP with `paramiko` and `scp`.
   - **SMTP**: Sending emails using the `smtplib` module.

2. **Process Automation**
   - **Subprocess Module**: Running shell commands and capturing output using the `subprocess` module.
   - **OS Module**: Interacting with the operating system for tasks such as directory creation and file listing using the `os` module.

3. **Other Python Libraries**
   - **JSON Parsing**: Serializing and deserializing JSON data using the `json` module.
   - **Web Scraping**: Parsing HTML and XML content using `BeautifulSoup` (bs4).
   - **Requests Module**: Making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using the `requests` module.
   - **Asynchronous Programming**: Examples of asynchronous code execution using `asyncio`.

## Usage Notes

- **Terminal-Only Outputs**: Some outputs, particularly for network protocols (e.g., Telnet, SSH, FTP) and subprocess command outputs, are better observed in a terminal environment. Running these in a Jupyter Notebook may not show real-time interaction outputs.
- **Local Execution**: To view the complete outputs:
  1. Download the files from this repository.
  2. Open the files locally:
     - Use **Anaconda** to open a Jupyter Notebook environment.
     - Use **Visual Studio Code** and install the **Jupyter Notebook extension** to run the files.
